# Discord-Chatbot
# Very simple discord chatbot that makes use of the OpenAI API and dicord.py python library
# You need to add a .env file with your Discord bot token (named 'DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN') and OpenAI token (named 'OPENAI_API_KEY')
# Bot has 3 commands, .start to start a session in a channel, .chat to chat with the bot and .end to end an existing session
# Conversations are channel specific, one channel can only have one session but you can have multiple sessions across different channels
